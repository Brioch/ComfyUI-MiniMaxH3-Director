# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — first public release

The LTX Director timeline editor by WhatDreamsCost, ported to MiniMax H3.

**Director**
- Timeline compiles to a storyboard prompt instead of a cross-attention relay mask
  (H3's DiT hardcodes `mask=None` over one packed `[text | cond | audio | video]` sequence).
- Two prompt notations, switchable in the gear menu: **MiniMax** (the notation from
  MiniMax's own prompt-writing guide, default) and **ComfyUI** (`[0s-1.5s] …`).
- Two optional model inputs — `fl2va` and `ref2va` are separate trainings; the toolbar
  switch picks the matching one.
- First/last keyframes only, matching H3's `PackedLayout`. Images elsewhere become
  `<Picture i>` references in Refs ON mode and are reported in the warnings otherwise.
- Reference-video track (`<Video k>`) replaces the IC-LoRA track — no IC-LoRAs exist for H3.
- Native joint audio; imported audio becomes `<Audio j>` and/or is muxed via `combined_audio`.
- Model-card limits enforced: ≤ 9 images, ≤ 3 videos (2–15 s each, ≤ 15 s total),
  ≤ 3 audio clips, ≤ 12 files in total.
- Live **COMPILED PROMPT** panel, served by the same planner the node runs — it cannot
  drift from what is actually encoded. Collapsing it, or switching it off in the gear
  menu, shrinks the node by exactly that much and releases the canvas underneath.

**Preview Override**
- Renders the whole shot while it denoises, instead of core's single first latent frame.
- Unpacks H3's packed AV latent (`unpack_latents`) — the callback receives the flat pack,
  not the nested view.
- Playback rate derived from the *output* duration, so the preview lasts as long as the
  finished shot (H3 compresses time ~3.35×).
- `latent2rgb` or the real video VAE, with a render-time overhead budget.
- `preview_fps` is a FLOAT input, so the Director's `fps` output wires straight in.

**Retake Stitch**
- Regenerate a marked range anchored on the base video's own frames either side, then
  splice head + retake + tail back together, video and audio.

**Director Chain**
- Renders past H3's ~15 s training range by chaining in-range windows, each anchored on
  the previous window's final frame. Samples internally; outputs finished images + audio.

**Removed from the LTX original**
- IC-LoRA track, Prompt Relay, audio inpainting, Licon MSR / Ghost Mask reference modes —
  none of them have a MiniMax H3 equivalent.
